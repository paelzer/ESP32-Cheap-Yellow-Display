## What is a Cheap Yellow Display (CYD)?

A CYD is a ESP32-2432S028, an ESP32 development board with a 2.8" display with a resistive touch screen,

There are other boards with different sizes displays that look similar but **are not** a CYD. This isn't to try exclude anyone, but there so many different displays and types that it would be incredibly difficult and very confusing to support all of them.

You can verify you have the correct board by checking the number on the back of the display.

## My CYD has two USB ports

The original CYD only has a micro USB port, but there is a device that is also labelled a _ESP32-2432S028_ that has two USB ports, one micro USB and one USB-C.

Having an additional USB port would be a minor problem if that was the only difference, but unfortunately the display also works differently, the colours are inverted on the display.

It can be fixed in a couple of ways:

- Use platformio - The examples on the Github have all been updated so they can be used with platformio, and you can simply select CYD or CYD2USB and it will just work
- Use the [CYD2USB specific User_setup.h](/DisplayConfig/CYD2USB/) that is on the repo, you can now use all the examples like normal
- Invert the display at the code level using the `tft.invertDisplay(1);` method

### The USB-C port doesn't work

The USB-C port has a flaw in it, it doesnâ€™t have the resistors on the CC lines. This means it will not work with USB-C to USB-C cables. If your computer only has USB-C ports, you can use it through a USB-C to USB-A adaptor.

### The Display doesn't look as good 

There seems to be a gamma issue with the CYD2USB (I don't even know what gamma is)

Adding this to the code seems to help

```
tft.writecommand(ILI9341_GAMMASET); //Gamma curve selected
tft.writedata(2);
delay(120);
tft.writecommand(ILI9341_GAMMASET); //Gamma curve selected
tft.writedata(1);
```
